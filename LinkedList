List of elements called nodes are connected together in single file line

2 types of linked list - Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List

Singly - Each node has reference to next node
Doubly - Each node has refernece to next as well as previous node

Need to know about 2 nodes to make it function i.e., Head Node and Tail Node

//Linkedlist code

//initial there will be no node
function LinkedList(){
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
}

function Node(value, next, prev){
    this.value = value;
    this.next = next;
    this.prev = prev;
}

var LL = new LinkedList(); //{head: null, tail : null}
var userList = new LinkedList(); //each instances are new linked list

var node1 = new Node(100, 'node2', null);
{value: 100, next: 'node2', prev: null}
